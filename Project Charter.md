## Abstract
When first registered, [preventhivok.org](http://preventhivok.org "Prevent HIV Oklahoma") was only going to be used as a repository for information about a proposed update of Oklahoma's [once progressive, now obsolete AIDS prevention education law](http://preventhivok.org/policy/education/current "70 O.S. 11-103.3 — AIDS prevention education • Prevent HIV Oklahoma "), originally outlined by Chris Shoaf and written by me, Curtis Blumer, entitled [HIV Prevention Education for the 21st Century](http://preventhivok.org/policy/education/revised "HIV Prevention Education for the 21st Century • Prevent HIV Oklahoma").

To that end, I launched this site on WordPress to quickly create the resource and to greatly ease the burden of administration and use by third parties—mainly by Mr Shoaf who has very little experience in web publishing. However, that very specific focus was greatly broadened while Mr Shoaf and I strategized about lobbying members of the State House of Representatives and Senate and discussing with he and Chuck Courtney about the launch of Tulsa Infectious Disease & AIDS League ("TIDAL")—the logical progression of the now-defunct AIDS Coalition of Tulsa ("ACT").

I realized that for all my complaints about no purpose-built, central resource for Oklahomans to find educational materials about human immunodeficiency virus ("HIV"), hepatitis C virus ("HCV"), and sexually transmittable infections ("STIs") and a comprehensive directory of HIV & STI testing facilities across the State, I wasn't doing anything to help rectify that problem. It became self-evident that with my possession of the requisite web development skills, compendium of information about HIV & STIs, and professional connections within the HIV community, I have an obligation to utilize my talents to create such a resource.
